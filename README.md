# Documentation

## Install
After cloning the repo, run the command `cd roh-cast-list-challenge` to move into the directory.
Next, run `npm i` in the terminal to install the dependencies.

*If CORS policy is preventing the app from running, you can find a browser extension to override it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc#:~:text=Moesif%20Origin%20%26%20CORS%20Changer&text=This%20plugin%20allows%20you%20to,without%20receiving%20Cross%20Origin%20Errors.).*

To start the React App on localhost, run the following commands in the terminal:
```bash
cd turandot-cast-sheet
npm start
```

# Process Journal
*A log of my work process, and the main learning points I've taken from this task.*

## 1) Planning & Setup

- **Define the shape of the project** <br>
I started by studying the brief carefully, and reviewing the structure of the JSON object and the example image. I created a component tree to plan the shape of the project and the state flow. I wanted to make the List component reusable to maximise efficiency, and to allow for scalability if any further lists needed to be added at a later date.
I also decided to keep my development process organised with GitFlow for good practice.

- **Check out existing resources**<br>
I also took a moment to look at an existing [Cast Sheet](./readme-images/cast-sheets.png) on the ROH website. I found that existing ROH digital Cast Sheets are designed to be viewed by the user on desktop and mobile devices. In the interest of time management, I added responsive styling as a stretch goal into my overall plan.

<a name="unittest"></a>
- **Plan a Unit Test**<br>
I wrote a basic unit test in Jest based on the method I was intending to use to render the List component. I wanted to impliment testing as early as possible in the project for Test Driven Development, but I realised I didn't have enough info on the data types I'd be working with to pre-plan the exact processes it would need to take. The unit test became a stretch goal in the interest of time keeping.

## 2) DATA & API CALL


- **Set up Fetch request**<br>
When making my first API call via. a Fetch request, I noticed a CORS issue in my browser console. I considered which approach would be preferred: creating a backend with and populating it with the provided data, creating a proxy server to access the API, or using a browser extension to disable CORS. In the interest of time management, I opted for the browser extension, and contacted the HR team to check if ROH had a preferred way of navigating the problem.


- **Test the Fetch request & rendering**<br>
As well as making use of console logs, I checked I was rendering the fetched data correctly by setting up a few of the necessary states, and adding a few essential values into the basic structure of my project. This served as a helpful starting point when referencing some of the deeper nested data objects later on.


- **Find the path to the correct data objects**<br>
When searching the JSON object for the values I needed, I knew that all the data (the cast names and roles for one specific activity) couldnâ€™t be found at the same level. With the link between the date and the cast names being the cast ID, I created a function to filter through the object and collect only the data that met the correct conditions. 

- **MVP achieved!**<br>
With all the correct data in place, here's what the [Minimum Viable Project](./readme-images/mvp-roh.png) looked like.

## 3) STYLING & ACCESSIBILITY
<a name="styling"></a>
- **Styling**<br>
I referred to the brief, the example image, and to [existing ROH Cast Sheets](https://www.roh.org.uk/tickets-and-events/40/the-magic-flute-by-david-mcvicar/cast-list/51323) when deciding how to style my project. I happened to find a PDF on [ROH Branding Guidelines](http://static.roh.org.uk/for/pdfs/ROH_GuidelinesSectionA.pdf), and used the recommended [font family, weights, and colours](./readme-images/branding-guidelines-roh.png) wherever possible to add some simple styling, endevouring to match a real-life ROH cast sheet as best I could in the time frame. If I'd had more time, I would have liked to continue improving the styling by adding media queries and controlling the responsiveness of the elements a bit more, as well as improving the alignment of the list items.

- **Accessibility**<br>
I was very keen to ensure my app's accessibility as much as possible throughout the project. Beyond accessible styling choices, such as font readability, contrast levels, and fallback fonts, I took care in using semantic elements wherever possible, giving each element a semantic class name, and using the correct order of heading hierarchy.<br><br>
I was faced with an ARIA challenge when creating the List component, as I wanted to add a dotted horizontal line between two `<p>` tags. I was attempting to style a `<span>` with `border-bottom:dashed` without success, and added a temporary workaround: a string of full-stops ( `<p>.....</p>` ). However, I knew that this was bad practice for screen readers. I did some research on `aria-hidden="true` . Whilst I found that it did work when I implimented it, and produced a perfect score on Lighthouse, my research suggested this method shouldn't be used on focusable elements. After some refactoring, I was able to use `border-bottom:dashed` with a `div` element instead. I really valued this process, and I'm very interested in learning more about the best practices of accessiblity.

## 4) REFACTORING & OPTIMISING

- **Tidying up**<br>
I took some time to refactor some helper functions, including formatting the date into the standard UK format. I removed my console logs, any unnessessary state, and made sure my comments were clear and descriptive.

- **Stretch Goals**<br>

    - sameLine function<br>
    I noticed on a real-life ROH Cast Sheet that when two or more people with the same creative role are working on one production, their names are displayed on one line, separated by a comma [(example)](./readme-images/same-role-creatives-roh.png). I would like to refactor my list function to return an element in this format if the same role was present in two places within the object.

    - `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`<br>
    After discovering a few `<p>` tags included in the JSON object, I wanted to know if there was a more efficient method of removing them than the checkTags function I created (removes the first 3 and the last 4 characters of the string if `<p>` is included). I found out about `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, the React alternative to setting `"innerHTML"`. Implementing this would allow me to display the string whilst running any HTML present within it. As the name "dangerously" suggests, this has some security risks, and I decided not to impliment this until I learn more about it in the near future.
